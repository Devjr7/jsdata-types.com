In JavaScript, a data type is the kind of value you store like a number or piece of text.

A variable is a named container that stores a value of a specific data type, allowing you to reference and manipulate it throughout your code.

You were able to create variables like x and y and then reference those throughout your program and do mathematical operations like addition. It is a similar concept in programming. You can create your own variable names and assign values to them. These values will be different data types.

Data types help the program understand the kind of data it's working with, whether it's a number, text, or something else.

JavaScript has several basic data types that you'll use in your programs. We'll explore each data type in greater detail in future lessons. For now, here is a brief introduction of the different data types in JavaScript.

The first data type we will look at is the Number type.

A Number represents both integers and floating-point values. Examples of integers include 7, 19, and 90.

The next data type is a String.

A String is a sequence of characters, or text, enclosed in quotes. Here is an example string using double quotes:

nother data type used in JavaScript is the Boolean type.

A Boolean represents one of two values: true or false. For example, a program might check whether a user is logged in (true) or not (false) and change the page based on that. If the user is logged in, you probably want to show them the dashboard page. Otherwise, you will want to show them the login page.

The next two data types used in JavaScript are undefined and null.

undefined means a variable has been declared but hasn't been given a value yet. You will learn more about this in the next lesson.

null means the variable has been intentionally set to "nothing" and does not hold any value. We will explore more on how this works in future lessons.

The last three data types are more complex in nature. These are objects, symbols and BigInt.

An Object is a collection of key-value pairs.

Objects are great for grouping related information together. You will learn more about how to work with objects in a future module.

A Symbol is a special type of value in JavaScript that is always unique and cannot be changed. It's often used to create unique labels or identifiers for properties:


BigInt is used for very large numbers that exceed the limit of the Number type:


Symbol and BigInt are two types that are less commonly used, but they are still important to know about.

Understanding these data types helps you handle and work with various kinds of data in your programs, as each type has its own characteristics and behaviors.
